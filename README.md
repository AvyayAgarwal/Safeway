# Safeway

2. Navigation from Point A to Point B by mapping out the safest route based on crime data
3. Providing SOS functionality for altering authorities
4. Location awareness notifications to warn users if they travel to areas with high crime rates

## Future additions
1. Crowd-sourced incident reporting

## Technologies Used
